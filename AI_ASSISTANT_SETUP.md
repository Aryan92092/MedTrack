2. Create an account or sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key" to generate a new key
4. Copy the generated API key
5. Set the environment variable (either works):

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
# or
$env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
rem or
set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
# or
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"API Key Issue" or "API key expired"**
   - **Root Cause**: Your Gemini API key has expired or is invalid
   - **Solution**: 
     - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
     - Generate a new API key
     - Update your environment variable: `$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your-new-api-key"`
     - Restart the application
   - **Prevention**: Set up API key rotation or monitor usage in Google AI Studio

2. **"Usage Limit Reached"**
   - **Root Cause**: You've exceeded the daily quota for Gemini API
   - **Solution**: Wait until the next day or upgrade your API plan
   - **Check**: Visit Google AI Studio dashboard to see usage statistics

3. **"AI Assistant not responding" (Generic)**
   - Check if GEMINI_API_KEY is set correctly
   - Verify your Gemini API key is valid and has quota
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure you're logged in to the application

4. **"CSV upload not working"**
   - Ensure the file is a valid CSV format
   - Check file size (should be reasonable for processing)
   - Verify the CSV has proper headers

5. **"Styling issues"**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check if all CSS files are loading properly
   - Verify the AI widget is included in base.html

### Getting Help
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Ensure the Flask application is running properly
- Test with simple questions first before complex queries

## Customization

### Modifying Quick Answers
Edit the `get_quick_answers()` method in `app/assistant.py` to customize the quick question buttons.

### Changing AI Model
By default the app uses `gemini-1.5-flash`.
To change it, set `GEMINI_MODEL` in your environment or `.env`, for example:
```
GEMINI_MODEL=models/gemini-2.5-pro
```

### Styling Customization
Modify the CSS classes in `app/static/styles.css` starting from line 1402 to customize the appearance.

## Cost Considerations
- Gemini API usage is charged per token (generous free tier available)
- Gemini Pro is cost-effective for most use cases
- Monitor your Google AI Studio usage dashboard for costs
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production use

Enjoy your new AI assistant! ðŸš€
